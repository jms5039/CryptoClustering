# CryptoClustering Challenge

In this challenge, we use unsupervised learning methods to analyze how cryptocurrencies are affected by changes in market prices over different timeframes.

### Instructions

#### 1. Prepare the Data

- Normalize the data using `StandardScaler`.
- Create a DataFrame with the scaled data.

#### 2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame

- Employ the elbow method to find the optimal value for k.

#### 3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

- Initialize K-Means with the best k value.
- Fit the model and predict clusters.
- Visualize clustering results with `hvPlot`.

#### 4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

- Perform PCA to reduce features to three principal components.
- Retrieve explained variance.

#### 5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

- Use the elbow method on PCA-reduced data.
- Discuss the differences in the best k value with the original data.

#### 6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

- Initialize K-Means with the best k value from PCA analysis.
- Fit the model on PCA data and predict clusters.
- Visualize the results with `hvPlot`.

#### 7. Composite Plot to Contrast the Clusters

- Create a composite plot to compare clustering before and after PCA.

### Discussion

Answer the question on the impact of using fewer features to cluster data using K-Means.
